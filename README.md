# Chronica ⏱️

A sleek, modern time tracking app built with Next.js for developers who demand both functionality and aesthetics.



As I was finally starting out with getting serious with my backend development journey, I realized I needed a reliable time tracking app to actually get my head down and get work done. It was disappointing that none of the existing web apps worked well on Windows, and even if they did, the UI was not appealing enough to keep me motivated.

So here we are - **Chronica** was born out of necessity and a desire for beautiful, functional design.

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 Beautiful Dark UI** - Minimal, modern interface with subtle gradients and smooth animations
- **⚡ Real-time Tracking** - Start, pause, and stop timers with precision
- **📱 Responsive Design** - Works flawlessly across all devices
- **🏗️ Custom Task Creation** - Create and organize your tasks exactly how you want
- **💾 Local Storage** - Your data stays with you, no account required
- **🌙 Fullscreen Timer Mode** - Distraction-free timing with keyboard shortcuts
- **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts** - ESC to minimize/stop, efficient workflow
- **🎯 Status Management** - Track task progress (in-progress, paused, completed)
